Below you'll find a set of tips on how to effectively use AI (e.g., ChatGPT, VS Code Copilot) while learning programming.

## Use AI as a Personal Mentor (Ask Until You Understand!)

AI can be your first `programming teacher`.
It doesn't always respond perfectly, but it's great at translating difficult concepts into simpler ones.

**Focus on the Basics**

When starting out, you don't need big frameworks or end-to-end tests right away.
The most important things are: variables, functions, loops, conditions, data types.

>
> ```
> Explain to me what a variable is in a way you'd talk to a 10-year-old.
> ```

**Dig Deeper**

If the definition is too theoretical, ask for examples or analogies.
This way, it's easier to understand abstract concepts and anchor them in practice.

> ```
> Show me that again, but with a cooking example
> ```

> ```
> Explain the for loop as if it were about cleaning hotel rooms
> ```
>
> This makes it easier to anchor knowledge in something familiar from life.

**Ask for Code**

Nothing reinforces learning like examples.
`Write a function in JavaScript that calculates the average grade`
This immediately shows you the practical application.
Code is a language you learn not from theory, but from use.

## Active Learning: Rewrite and Modify (Zero Copying)

The biggest mistake beginners make is passivity.
Watching tutorials or copying code from AI looks like learning... but it's not!

**Rewrite Code Manually**

When AI generates a solution, e.g., a function checking if a number is even – don't copy it.
Rewrite it yourself. Line by line.
It's like learning a foreign language: if you only read, you remember little. But when you repeat sentences yourself – you learn faster.

**Experiment**

You have a ready example?
Change something!

Add an extra condition, replace numbers with text, deliberately insert an error.
`What happens if I type - instead of +?`.
Such testing gives you experience you won't get from reading theory.

## Apply the "You First, Then AI" Technique

It's easiest to fall into the trap of asking AI for a solution right away.
But the greatest learning happens when you try first.

**Solve Independently**

You got a task:
`write a function that reverses text`.
Stop.
Try to come up with something, even if it takes 30 minutes.
`I don't know if it'll work, but I'll try` – that's the moment when your brain learns the most.

**Debug with AI**

Your code doesn't work? That's normal.
Paste it into AI and write:

`My code returns undefined, explain why`

AI will explain step by step where you went wrong.
This way, you learn to think like a programmer: analyzing errors, finding causes, fixing code.

> [!TIP]
> Apply the 15-minute rule. First work alone for 15 minutes, then ask AI for help.

## Use AI to Generate Questions and Quizzes

You don't always have to ask for solutions.
AI is great as a generator of tasks and questions that test your knowledge.

**Generating Problems**

Say: `Prepare 5 questions about for loops in JavaScript, but don't provide answers`.

Then try to answer yourself, and only at the end ask AI for verification.
It's a bit like gym exercises – you don't want someone lifting the weights for you.

> [!TIP]
> First try to answer yourself, and only then check your answers with AI.

## Integrate AI with Your Learning Plan and Other Resources

AI is a great helper, but it can't be your only source of knowledge.

**Planning and Goals**

You can ask AI for a learning plan:
`Prepare a 4-week JavaScript learning plan for a beginner tester`.
But remember – that's just a starting point.

**Combining Sources**

AI gives quick answers, but you build real skills through practice.
Read documentation (e.g., Playwright), take online courses, work on small projects.

`I made a mini ToDo app and saw that every bug is a new lesson`
– that's the path to development.

> [!TIP]
> Plan your week like this: 3 days coding, 2 days quizzes and reviews with AI. This provides balance between practice and theory.

# Things to Watch Out for When Using AI

## Uncritical Reliance on Code and Lack of Understanding

AI can write code faster than you.
But that doesn't mean you understand it or that it's correct!

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't understand that code – it's like driving a car without knowing where the brake is.

**Your Responsibility**

The code you submit is signed with your name.
If you don't understand what's happening in it, you're taking the risk.

**Lack of Development**

If you always ask AI, you don't learn the language or tools.
You don't discover IDE shortcuts, you don't learn built-in code snippets.
You start relying only on AI – and then your skills stagnate.

**Dependence**

It's a bit like a calculator. If you always calculate with it, you lose the ability to calculate in your head.
AI can give you the feeling that `you already know how to program`, but it's just an **illusion**.

> [!TIP]
> Every time you use code from AI, ask yourself: `Do I understand every line of this code?`.

## Risk of Generating Incorrect, Outdated, or Inefficient Code

AI doesn't understand programming like a human.
For it, code is a string of characters that _most likely_ fit.

**Hallucinations**

AI can invent a library that doesn't exist and present it confidently.
`Just use the magic-tools.js package` – and such a package never existed!

**Inefficiency**

Code from AI can be too long, repetitive, hard to maintain.
You learn bad habits and inefficient solutions.

**Outdatedness**

AI often provides solutions from several years ago.
In the IT world, that's a huge problem – some methods have long been considered outdated.

> [!TIP]
> Always check the code in the official documentation.

## Neglecting Security Issues

Code from AI may look correct, but hide serious holes.

**Security Vulnerabilities**

Example: AI generates SQL queries without protections, vulnerable to SQL injection.
That's a mistake that can cost a company huge money.

**Data Confidentiality**

Never paste real data into AI – credit card numbers, passwords, customer data.
It's like sending them to a stranger on chat.

> [!TIP]
> Treat your data like a bank PIN – never give it to AI.

## Lack of Business and Architectural Context

AI doesn't understand why your project exists and what its goals are.
It can help with code, but not assess if the solution fits the requirements.

**Strategic Decisions**

AI won't answer: `Will this feature solve the user's problem?`
That's the role of the programmer, tester, and the whole team.

> [!TIP]
> Always ask yourself: `Does this solution meet my needs?`.

## Limiting Innovation and Learning from Mistakes

Making mistakes is part of learning.
If AI fixes them right away, you lose the opportunity for reflection and thinking `why something doesn't work`.

**Lack of Learning from Mistakes**

When something doesn't work, think: `What could I have done wrong?`.
AI can help later, but the first step should be yours.

**Hindering Creativity**

AI is great at solving problems someone has already described.
But true innovation is something AI doesn't know.
If you always ask AI, you don't develop your own creativity.

**Use AI Sparingly**

At the beginning of your programming journey, the most important thing is writing code with your own hands.
It's this process – attempts, errors, corrections – that teaches you the most.

> [!NOTE]
> AI can be like training wheels on a bike for you.
> They help, but if you don't give them up, you'll never learn to ride for real.

> [!TIP]
> First try on your own, even if you make mistakes.
> You'll learn more from mistakes than from a ready solution from AI.
