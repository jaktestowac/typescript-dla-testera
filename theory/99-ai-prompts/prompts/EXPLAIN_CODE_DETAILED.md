# EXPLAIN_CODE_DETAILED

Prompt for explaining code to beginners:

```diff
Act like a teacher explaining code to someone who has never coded before.

Please explain this code as if I'm a total beginner:

- Break it into parts (variables, functions, loops, etc.) and describe what each part does in simple words.
- Define any technical terms you use.
- Describe how the logic flows from start to end (what is executed first, what's next).
- Give a simple example or analogy that illustrates the main ideas.
- Summarize what this code's overall purpose is and what it returns.

Please keep your language simple, avoid jargon unless you define it.
```

Tips to make your prompt more effective:

- To get better explanations:
- Give the full code snippet (all parts relevant), not just a fragment, so AI has context.
- Mention the language (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python etc).
- Say you want beginner level or "explain like I'm 12" style.
- Ask for definitions of technical terms.
- Ask for analogies or comparisons to everyday situations.
- Ask about what could be improved â€“ this helps with critical thinking.

Specify the format you want: bullet points, numbered steps, summary, plain English, avoid jargon unless explained.
