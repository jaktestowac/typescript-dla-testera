# Task Manager Mini-Project

This mini-project guides you through building a task management application in TypeScript, step by step.

Each stage adds new functionality while building on the previous stage.

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse code snippets from previous stages to avoid duplication and save time!

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Task Creation (`1-stage-task-manager.ts`)

- Learn to create simple task objects
- Implement basic task creation and completion tracking
- Understand object organization and basic data structures

### Stage 2: Task Priority System (`2-stage-task-manager.ts`)

- Add priority levels (High/Medium/Low) using enums
- Extend task creation to include priority assignment
- Practice enum usage and conditional logic

### Stage 3: Task Due Dates (`3-stage-task-manager.ts`)

- Add due date functionality with date handling
- Implement deadline checking and overdue detection
- Learn about Date objects and date comparisons

### Stage 4: Task Categories and Filtering (`4-stage-task-manager.ts`)

- Add task categories/tags system
- Implement filtering by category and priority
- Learn about array filtering and search functionality

### Stage 5: TaskManager Class with Advanced Features (`5-stage-task-manager.ts`)

- Create a TaskManager class with comprehensive functionality
- **NEW**: Learn about task statistics and reporting
- Add task search and sorting capabilities
- Implement task editing and deletion
- **NEW**: Use enums in object-oriented code
- Learn about encapsulation and class design
- **NEW**: Comprehensive testing suite with detailed verification steps
- **Simplified**: Broken down into 8 clear steps

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 is broken down into small, manageable steps. Start with just the basic class and add method, then gradually add more features. Don't try to implement everything at once!

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 includes a comprehensive testing suite.
> Run each test step by step and compare your output with the expected results to verify your implementation!

## How to Use

1. Start with Stage 1 and implement the required functions
2. Run the code and verify the expected output
3. Move to the next stage and build upon your previous work
4. Each stage includes test cases with expected results

## Learning Objectives

- Object creation and manipulation
- Enum usage for categorization
- Date handling and comparisons
- Array operations and filtering
- Class-based programming
- Search and sorting algorithms
- Data organization and management

## Expected Output

Each stage includes console.log statements that should produce the expected output shown in the comments.
