# BMI Calculator Mini-Project

This mini-project guides you through building a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator in TypeScript, step by step.

Each stage adds new functionality while building on the previous stage.

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse code snippets from previous stages to avoid duplication and save time!

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic BMI Calculation (`1-stage-bmi-calculator.ts`)

- Learn to create simple functions for mathematical calculations
- Implement BMI formula: weight / (height in meters)Â²
- Understand unit conversion in calculations

### Stage 2: BMI Categories (`2-stage-bmi-calculator.ts`)

- Add BMI category classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Learn conditional logic for categorization
- Combine calculation and categorization

### Stage 3: Input Validation (`3-stage-bmi-calculator.ts`)

- Add input validation for weight and height
- Learn error handling in calculations
- Understand importance of data validation

### Stage 4: Multiple Calculations and History (`4-stage-bmi-calculator.ts`)

- Handle multiple BMI calculations
- Learn array processing and statistics
- Calculate averages and distributions

### Stage 5: Simple BMI Calculator Class (`5-stage-bmi-calculator.ts`)

- Create a simple class to organize functionality
- Learn basic object-oriented concepts
- Combine all previous features in a class

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 introduces classes but keeps it simple - focus on organizing functions into methods. Don't worry about advanced OOP concepts!

## Solutions

Each stage has a corresponding solution file in the `solutions/` folder:

- `1-stage-bmi-calculator-solution.ts`
- `2-stage-bmi-calculator-solution.ts`
- `3-stage-bmi-calculator-solution.ts`
- `4-stage-bmi-calculator-solution.ts`
- `5-stage-bmi-calculator-solution.ts`

## Testing Your Code

Run your code using:

```bash
npx tsx <filename>.ts
```

Compare your output with the expected output shown in each exercise file.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this mini-project, you will learn:

- **Mathematical Calculations**: BMI formula and unit conversions
- **Conditional Logic**: if-else statements for categorization
- **Input Validation**: Checking data validity and error handling
- **Array Processing**: Working with arrays of data
- **Basic Statistics**: Calculating averages and distributions
- **Simple Classes**: Organizing code with basic OOP concepts
- **Error Handling**: Managing invalid inputs gracefully

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Stage 1 and build incrementally
2. **Test Frequently**: Run your code after each major change
3. **Reuse Code**: Copy working code from previous stages
4. **Read Error Messages**: TypeScript errors are helpful for learning
5. **Experiment**: Try different weight/height combinations

Happy coding! ðŸš€
