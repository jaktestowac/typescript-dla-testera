# Calculator Mini-Project

This mini-project guides you through building a calculator in TypeScript, step by step.

Each stage adds new functionality while building on the previous stage.

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse code snippets from previous stages to avoid duplication and save time!

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Addition (`1-stage-calculator.ts`)

- Learn to create simple functions
- Implement basic addition operation
- Understand function organization

### Stage 2: Addition and Subtraction (`2-stage-calculator.ts`)

- Add subtraction functionality
- Extend the calculate function to handle multiple operations
- Practice conditional logic

### Stage 3: Basic Operations with Enums (`3-stage-calculator.ts`)

- Add multiplication
- Continue building the calculator with more operations
- **NEW**: Learn to use enums for operation types
- Understand type safety with enums vs strings

### Stage 4: All Basic Operations with Enums (`4-stage-calculator.ts`)

- Add division with error handling
- Handle edge cases like division by zero
- Learn about error handling in calculations

### Stage 5: Advanced Calculator with Enums (`5-stage-calculator.ts`)

- Create a Calculator class with step-by-step guidance
- **NEW**: Learn why memory is useful in calculators (M+, MR, MC functions)
- Add memory functionality with practical examples
- Implement operation history
- **NEW**: Use enums in object-oriented code
- Learn about encapsulation and class design
- **NEW**: Comprehensive testing suite with detailed verification steps
- **Simplified**: Broken down into 7 clear steps

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 is broken down into small, manageable steps. Start with just the basic class and add method, then gradually add more features. Don't try to implement everything at once!
>
> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 includes a comprehensive testing suite. Run each test step by step and compare your output with the expected results to verify your implementation!

## How to Use

1. Start with Stage 1 and implement the required functions
2. Run the code and verify the expected output
3. Move to the next stage and build upon your previous work
4. Each stage includes test cases with expected results

## Learning Objectives

- Function creation and usage
- Conditional statements
- Error handling
- Class-based programming
- Memory management
- History tracking

## Expected Output

Each stage includes console.log statements that should produce the expected output shown in the comments.
