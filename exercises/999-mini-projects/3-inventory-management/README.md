# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management Mini-Project

This mini-project guides you through building an inventory management system in TypeScript, step by step.

Each stage adds new functionality while building on the previous stage.

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse code snippets from previous stages to avoid duplication and save time!

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Item Creation (`1-stage-inventory.ts`)

- Learn to create simple item objects
- Implement basic item creation and stock tracking
- Understand object organization and basic data structures

### Stage 2: Item Categories System (`2-stage-inventory.ts`)

- Add item categories using enums
- Extend item creation to include category assignment
- Practice enum usage and conditional logic

### Stage 3: Price Tracking (`3-stage-inventory.ts`)

- Add price functionality with total value calculations
- Implement price updates and inventory valuation
- Learn about number operations and financial calculations

### Stage 4: Stock Alerts and Filtering (`4-stage-inventory.ts`)

- Add stock level monitoring and alerts
- Implement filtering by category, stock status, and price range
- Learn about array filtering and conditional logic

### Stage 5: InventoryManager Class with Advanced Features (`5-stage-inventory.ts`)

- Create an InventoryManager class with comprehensive functionality
- **NEW**: Learn about inventory statistics and reporting
- Add item search and sorting capabilities
- Implement item editing and removal
- **NEW**: Use enums in object-oriented code
- Learn about encapsulation and class design
- **NEW**: Comprehensive testing suite with detailed verification steps
- **Simplified**: Broken down into 8 clear steps

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 is broken down into small, manageable steps. Start with just the basic class and add method, then gradually add more features. Don't try to implement everything at once!

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 includes a comprehensive testing suite.
> Run each test step by step and compare your output with the expected results to verify your implementation!

## How to Use

1. Start with Stage 1 and implement the required functions
2. Run the code and verify the expected output
3. Move to the next stage and build upon your previous work
4. Each stage includes test cases with expected results

## Learning Objectives

- Object creation and manipulation
- Enum usage for categorization
- Mathematical calculations and financial operations
- Array operations and filtering
- Class-based programming
- Search and sorting algorithms
- Data organization and management

## Expected Output

Each stage includes console.log statements that should produce the expected output shown in the comments.
