# Todo List Mini-Project

This mini-project guides you through building a comprehensive todo list application in TypeScript, step by step.

Each stage adds new functionality while building on the previous stage.

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse code snippets from previous stages to avoid duplication and save time!

## Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Task Management (`1-stage-todo.ts`)

- Learn to create interfaces and classes
- Implement basic task creation and removal
- Understand data structure organization

### Stage 2: Task Completion (`2-stage-todo.ts`)

- Add task completion functionality
- Learn array filtering techniques
- Separate completed and pending tasks

### Stage 3: Task Priorities (`3-stage-todo.ts`)

- Add priority levels to tasks
- **NEW**: Learn to use enums for categorical data
- Understand default parameters in functions
- Filter tasks by priority

### Stage 4: Due Dates (`4-stage-todo.ts`)

- Add due date functionality
- **NEW**: Learn to work with dates in TypeScript
- Handle overdue tasks and tasks due today
- Understand optional properties in interfaces

### Stage 5: Advanced Features (`5-stage-todo.ts`)

- Create advanced filtering and sorting methods
- **NEW**: Learn array sorting techniques
- Add search functionality with string methods
- Implement task summary statistics
- **NEW**: Comprehensive testing with multiple scenarios
- **Simplified**: Broken down into clear, manageable steps

> [!TIP]
> Stage 5 includes advanced features like sorting and searching. Start with basic methods and gradually add complexity. Test each feature individually!

## Solutions

Each stage has a corresponding solution file in the `solutions/` folder:

- `1-stage-todo-solution.ts`
- `2-stage-todo-solution.ts`
- `3-stage-todo-solution.ts`
- `4-stage-todo-solution.ts`
- `5-stage-todo-solution.ts`

## Testing Your Code

Run your code using:

```bash
npx tsx <filename>.ts
```

Compare your output with the expected output shown in each exercise file.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this mini-project, you will learn:

- **TypeScript Fundamentals**: Interfaces, classes, enums, and type safety
- **Data Management**: Arrays, filtering, sorting, and searching
- **Date Handling**: Working with dates and time comparisons
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Encapsulation and class design
- **Advanced Array Methods**: filter(), sort(), find(), and map()
- **String Manipulation**: Case-insensitive searching
- **Optional Properties**: Handling optional data in interfaces

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Stage 1 and build incrementally
2. **Test Frequently**: Run your code after each major change
3. **Reuse Code**: Copy working code from previous stages
4. **Read Error Messages**: TypeScript errors are helpful for learning
5. **Experiment**: Try modifying the code to see how it behaves

Happy coding! ðŸš€
